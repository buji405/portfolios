## Gear Up

### Community Gear Up: Mod 4 Leads:
I co-lead this gearup on failing gracefully. We talked about ways to better deal with failing and how to normalize failing so that it isn't such an uncomfortable subject. 
We talked about the people who never take risks and try things because they are too scared to fail. I found this all relatable because everyone fails sometimes and it's how you deal with it and bounce back that's important. 

### M4 Gear Up: Session Design:
This was a brainstorming gear up where we spent the majority of the hour hammering down ideas and grouping people into them. We then spent the 2nd half with our groups 
getting together material and a rough game plan of how we were going to lead our gear up. 

### M4 Gear Up: Session Redesign:
Our last time to meet with our group to really get everything together for our plan of running the gear up. Provided all notes to Ellen Mary. 

### F: Feedback

Didn't get any from project partners. Brittany's feedback to me was to work on my confidence when articulating technical concepts like on the whiteboard.
